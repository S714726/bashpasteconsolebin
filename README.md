slambam-direct
==============
slambam-direct takes console output recorded by 
[youterm script](https://github.com/quantumdream/yt-script) (a
variation of script(1) that records color escape codes) and uploads it
to a server, correctly marking up the results in color. This could be
marginally useful to somebody some day.

Usage
-----
Run the server with whatever command, prepare to intercept files!
